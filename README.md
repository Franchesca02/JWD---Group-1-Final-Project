Repository Description
I want an application that accepts user input.
I want to be prompted for information about my application.
I want my project title to display as the title of the README.
We overcame a lot of issues as a group and all of us came out stronger and better for it.
The major challenge was that at some point, the group members had some issues with the Github collaborations which led to duplicate codes and made the UI unattractive
and scattered the main branch on the group repository.
In solving this, we decided that one person could figure it out to look better and push to the main branch so everyone else can clone that to continue their tasks.
